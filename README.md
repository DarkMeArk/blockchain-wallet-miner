Create a fully functional, real-world blockchain wallet app with mining and transaction capabilities with GUI and create backend development, security considerations, integration with blockchain networks, and more, provide a basic structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end of a blockchain wallet app and implement the backend using a server-side language like Node.js, Python, etc., and integrate with a blockchain network using APIs or SDKs. so generate a mobile responsive code for HTML, CSS AND JavaScript, to do actual blockchain integration with this app sign transactions, handle private keys securely, and interact with the blockchain network's API or SDK.
ChatGPT says that, Creating a fully functional, real-world blockchain wallet app with actual blockchain integration, secure transaction signing, and private key handling is a complex task that requires careful consideration of security practices. The example below demonstrates a simplified version of a blockchain wallet app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The blockchain integration is done using the BlockCypher API for Bitcoin. Note that this is for educational purposes, and in a production environment, additional security measures are crucial.
